# throttle-ts
fully functional typescript throttle function

Main goal :

Creating a highly performing throttle function implemented in TypeScript and fully covered by tests with no external dependencies. This function should return a super handler function that shares the same signature as the input handler and always returns a value when invoked and is capable of being triggered on trailing or leading edges.
